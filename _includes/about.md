I'm a full stack software engineer in New York City. I've been building websites and making engaging products ever since I was a teenager. I enjoy writing [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) applications and thrive in startup environments.

When I'm not working, I spend my time at the gym, cooking and being adventurous. Ever since I decided to [take a stand on my weight](https://medium.com/steves-health-journey/my-transformation-story-305e0e84eae4), I made my health and well-being a priority.

I graduated with a degree in ECE from [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/) and currently work for an awesome startup, [Abacus](https://abacus.com). If you want more of the nitty-gritties, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenlu).

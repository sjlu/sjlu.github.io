Everything revolves around what you eat. The quote “you are what you eat” really
applies strongly here. Even if you’re hitting it hard at the gym, it’s what you do
during recovery that really makes a gorgeous body. So if I were to choose one thing
to start off with, it would be your diet.

Most people think the word “diet” as a eating manual that they have to follow for
a short amount of time. Phrases like “it only lasts a little while longer” will
only cause you to fail at it. Most athletes and bodybuilders will tell you that
their diet typically lasts for their entire carrier. That means that they never
stop! If we lookup the word “diet” in the dictionary, it’ll mention “what a person…
habitually eats”. Yes, that means in order to diet successfully, you have to make
these changes in your habits to reach a sustainable, healthier lifestyle.

I actually feel bad for people who are thrown diet at them and are told to jump
right into it. I can’t remember any time where I or anyone in my life has actually
kept a crazy diet plan. Yes, I’ll admit I’ve tried many different things like
low-carb (Atkins), food palettes (eating only certain things) and calorie deficits
but none of them stuck. In the past, those diets for me were tough and when things
are difficult to complete they take a toll on you mentally and eventually force you
to stop.

So this is where I recommend that you build your basics first and lay out the
groundwork before worrying about the numbers, the types of food you’re eating
or any other particular details. These things really only tweak the last 10-15%
of your diet and show very little improvements. Therefore, I suggest focusing on
one basic piece at a time until each one becomes a habit or something that you do
without question. These pieces can be anything, but some of the ones I love
suggesting are:

* Eating meals regularly and not skipping any
* Replacing meals in your day with ones that you prepare yourself
* Grocery shopping
* Removing processed foods or anything you can’t pronounce in the ingredients
* Limiting the amount of take out and restaurants you go to


Now it usually takes a month for a habit to form so it’ll take some time to complete.
But once you get these down everything else about a diet becomes a lot easier since
it is the blueprint to them. When you feel like you have a grip on all of this, I would
suggest an alternate Paleo diet to help you go beyond your goals (which is the diet
I follow).

title: The 2015 Race Season
---

This year I will be *attempting* to complete **3 trifectas** or 9 [Spartan races](http://spartan.com) and another **3** [Tough Mudder](http://toughmudder.com) races. I know, it's crazy. Perhaps even impossible. But what'd makes these races even more fun is if I do it with friends! So let me know if you want to join me and I promise I'll run with you the entire time.

For those who don't know what Spartan races are, they are obstacle course races that usually take place on a mountain. The **beast** is a ~15 mile course, the **super** being ~8 miles and the **sprint** being ~5 miles. Tough Mudder has only one configuration which is roughly ~12 miles and does not really have any inclines. It does have a lot of mud and focuses a ton more on teamwork.

Here's my event list and the people that I'll be running with. I have not registered all of them yet, so let me know if you're interested in any of the ones without a team name! I also have a couple of discount codes that you can use too!

Friend Gifter helps you find gifts for your friends that have upcoming birthdays. We know you don't know all of your Facebook friends so we do the hard part for you. Login to your Facebook account it will search your friends that have birthdays coming up. When you select a friend, we then prediect what they could like and suggest gifts based those likes.

Friend Gifter won "Best use of Heroku" and "Best Overall Application" during Facebook's World Hack in Austin, TX 2012.

The icon design and background was made with help from [Kenneth Jaffe](http://kennethjaffe.com/). The source code can found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sjlu/fb-bday-gifts).

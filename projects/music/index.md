This Facebook application was built initially out of spite of another application which I found unusable. It mimicked the ability to place any song onto your MySpace profile, but on your Facebook profile instead. Since it was one of the first 100 applications to be published on the Facebook platform, it became a hit and was converted into a product where it became a tool for artists to reach out with their music.

During the lifespan of the product, it had over 8 million users, half of which were active per month. On average, Music had 500 million listens per year and averaged near 40 requests per second. I also received contracted and received help from [Russell Frank](http://russfrank.us) and [Frances Soong](http://francessoong.com).

Because Facebook's design was so volatile in the early days, it was hard to keep up and therefore reached its end of life and no longer exists. The code has recently become open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/burstdev/fb-music-app) for anyone to browse.

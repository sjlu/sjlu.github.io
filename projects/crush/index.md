title: "Crush With Cupid"
---

Crush With Cupid was a Facebook application that allowed friends to select who they have a crush on.
If a crush was mutually found between two people, they where immediately contacted about each other
with a special deal from LivingSocial or Groupon. If there is no match, they remain completely anonymous.

Crush with Cupid was built with [Liz Jamora](http://lizjamora.com) and [Zach Myrow](http://zachmyrow.com/).
It also had a [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/crushwithcupid) and a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/crushwithcupid)
for social outreach and the source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sjlu/crush-with-cupid).

NextBeezy is an application built on top of the NextBus service. Most of the time you're on a routine and the only things you want to see is the Routes and Stops that you need. You set it up once and see exactly what you want. 

I'd like to thank Wayne Sun, Jason Caetano, Juan Barzuto, Phil Femano and Catherine Yu for their help and insights on the application.

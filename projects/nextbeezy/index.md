NextBeezy was built to help Rutgers students know when their bus is arriving to
the stations that they care about most. Because most students had a routine,
it was made to set and forget where you'd only see bus times that mattered to
you the most.

NextBeezy can be downloaded from the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nextbeezy-rutgers/id518122298?ls=1&mt=8) for free. The icon used was created by [Wayne Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uusunn).
